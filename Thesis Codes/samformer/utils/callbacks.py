class CaptureWeightsCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    """
    Custom TensorFlow callback for capturing and logging model weights during training, with a focus on attention weights.

    This callback is designed to monitor the evolution of model weights, particularly attention weights, across training epochs.
    It facilitates the analysis of training dynamics and model behavior by storing weight snapshots at specified intervals.

    Attributes:
        model (tf.keras.Model): Instance of the TensorFlow model being trained. The model should have a method
                                `get_last_attention_weights()` that this callback can invoke to obtain attention weights.
        attention_weights_history (list): Accumulates the attention weights captured at the end of specified epochs. 
                                          This history facilitates post-training analysis of weight adjustments.

    Methods:
        on_epoch_end(epoch, logs=None): Overrides the base class method to capture attention weights at the end of each epoch.
                                        Weights are captured based on specified criteria, e.g., every 5 epochs.
        get_attention_weights_history(): Provides access to the accumulated history of attention weights captured during training.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, model):
        """
        Initializes the callback with a specific model to monitor its attention weights during training.

        Parameters:
            model (tf.keras.Model): The model whose attention weights are to be monitored and captured.

        """
        Called at the end of an epoch during training to capture and store attention weights if the current
        epoch satisfies the capture criteria (e.g., every 5 epochs).

        Parameters:
            epoch (int): The current epoch number.
            logs (dict): Currently unused. Contains logs from the training epoch.
        """

def setup_callbacks(args, checkpoint_path, model):
    """
    Sets up and returns TensorFlow callbacks for use during model training. These callbacks include early stopping,
    learning rate scheduling, model checkpointing, and a custom callback for capturing model weights.

    This function is tailored to support flexible training configurations, allowing for dynamic adjustment of training
    behavior based on model performance and training progress.

    Parameters:
        args (argparse.Namespace): Parsed command-line arguments containing training configurations such as patience for early stopping,
                                   total training epochs, and initial learning rate.
        checkpoint_path (str): File path where model checkpoints will be saved. The best model according to validation loss is checkpointed.
        model (tf.keras.Model): The TensorFlow model being trained. Required for initializing the `CaptureWeightsCallback`.
        model_name (str): Name of the model being trained. This can be used to adjust callback behavior for different models.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
               - A list of TensorFlow callbacks configured for the training session.
               - An instance of `CaptureWeightsCallback`, which can be used post-training to access captured weights.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs in the setup of callbacks, an exception is logged and raised to prevent silent training failures.

    Example:
        >>> callbacks, capture_weights_callback = setup_callbacks(args, './model_checkpoints', model, 'my_model')
        This example demonstrates how to invoke `setup_callbacks` to obtain configured callbacks for training, including a custom
        weight capture callback for post-training analysis.
