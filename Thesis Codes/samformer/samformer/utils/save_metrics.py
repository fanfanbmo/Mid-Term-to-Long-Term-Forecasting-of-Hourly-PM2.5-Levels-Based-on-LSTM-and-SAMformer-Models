def save_training_history(history, args, current_directory):
    """
    Saves the training history, including epoch numbers, model name, prediction horizon,
    dataset used, whether SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization) was used, training loss, and validation loss,
    to a CSV file. The file is named based on the model, dataset, and whether SAM was employed,
    ensuring unique filenames for different training configurations.

    The function appends the new training history to the existing file if it already exists,
    allowing for cumulative recording of training sessions without overwriting previous data.

    Parameters:
        history (tf.keras.callbacks.History): The training history object returned by the fit method
                                              of a Keras model. It contains loss metrics recorded over
                                              each epoch of training.
        args (argparse.Namespace): A namespace object containing command line arguments. Expected
                                   to include 'model' (the model name), 'pred_len' (prediction horizon),
                                   'data' (the dataset name), and 'use_sam' (a boolean indicating if SAM
                                   was used during training).
        current_directory (str): The directory path where the training history CSV file will be saved.
                                 The function constructs a subdirectory named 'results' within this path
                                 to store the file.

    Outputs:
        A CSV file named 'history_[model name]_[dataset]{_sam if SAM was used}.csv' in the
        '[current_directory]/results' directory. The file contains columns for epoch number, model name,
        prediction horizon, dataset, SAM usage, training loss, and validation loss. If the file already exists,
        the function appends the new data to it, preserving any existing data.

    Example Filename:
        'results/history_modelname_datasetname_sam.csv' if SAM was used,
        'results/history_modelname_datasetname.csv' if SAM was not used.

def save_additional_metrics(model, args, train_data, current_directory, capture_weights_callback):
    """
    Saves additional metrics including attention weights and sharpness, if the --add_results
    command line argument is specified. Attention weights are calculated on a batch of 32 sequences
    every 5 epochs by default, which is the capture frequency set in the CaptureWeightsCallback.
    The sharpness, measured as the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix, is computed using
    power iteration at the end of the training process.

    Parameters:
        model (tf.keras.Model): The trained model.
        args (argparse.Namespace): Command line arguments specified by the user. Must include
                                   'add_results' to indicate if additional results should be saved.
        train_data (tf.data.Dataset): The training dataset used to compute sharpness.
        current_directory (str): The current working directory where results are saved.
        capture_weights_callback (CaptureWeightsCallback): The callback instance used during training
                                                           to capture attention weights.

    Note:
        - The attention weights are saved as a NumPy array (.npy) file.
        - The sharpness (largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix) is saved in a CSV file.
