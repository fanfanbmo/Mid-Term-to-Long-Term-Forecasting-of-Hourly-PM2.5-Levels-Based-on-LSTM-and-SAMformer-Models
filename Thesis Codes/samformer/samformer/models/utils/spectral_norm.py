# of attention entropy collapse through the sigma-reparameterization technique.
# 
# The adaptation and modifications to the original concept for TensorFlow were developed to meet
# the specific requirements of our projects, ensuring compatibility and performance within the TensorFlow
# ecosystem. This implementation facilitates the practical application of the sigma-reparameterization

    Spectral Normalized Multi-Head Attention Layer.
    
    This layer extends the MultiHeadAttention layer with spectral normalization on the
    query, key, and value weights, implementing the sigma-reparam method described in
    "Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse".
