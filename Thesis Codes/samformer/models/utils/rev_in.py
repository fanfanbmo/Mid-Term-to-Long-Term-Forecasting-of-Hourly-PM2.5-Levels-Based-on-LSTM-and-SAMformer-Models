class RevNorm(layers.Layer):
  """
  Implements Reversible Instance Normalization (RevNorm).

  This layer normalizes input features per instance and can reverse the normalization process. It is designed
  to maintain the statistical properties of the input data, making it particularly useful in generative models
  where the exact inverse operation is necessary.

  Attributes:
      axis (int): The axis along which to compute the mean and standard deviation for normalization.
      eps (float): A small constant added to the standard deviation to prevent division by zero.
      affine (bool): Whether to apply a learnable affine transformation after normalization.

  The original implementation can be found in the Google Research repository:
  https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/tsmixer/tsmixer_basic/models/rev_in.py

  Example usage:
      rev_norm = RevNorm(axis=-1, eps=1e-5, affine=True)
      normalized_output = rev_norm(input_tensor, mode='norm')
      denormalized_output = rev_norm(normalized_output, mode='denorm', target_slice=slice_indices)
  """

  def __init__(self, axis, eps=1e-5, affine=True):
    super().__init__()
    self.axis = axis  # Defines the dimension along which normalization is performed.
    self.eps = eps  # Small epsilon value to ensure numerical stability.
    self.affine = affine  # Determines if learnable affine parameters should be used.

  def build(self, input_shape):
    """
    Initializes the layer's weights.

    This method creates affine transformation weights if the `affine` attribute is set to True.
    It defines two trainable weights, `affine_weight` and `affine_bias`, which are used to scale and shift
    the normalized data respectively.

    Args:
        input_shape (TensorShape): The shape of the input tensor to the layer. The last dimension is used
                                   to determine the shape of the affine weights.

    Note: This method is automatically called during the first use of the layer.

        x (Tensor): Input tensor from which the statistics are computed.

    Updates:
        self.mean (Tensor): The mean of the input tensor, calculated along the specified axis.
        self.stdev (Tensor): The standard deviation of the input tensor, ensuring numerical stability by adding `self.eps`.

    Normalizes the input tensor using the computed mean and standard deviation.

    This method subtracts the mean from the input tensor and divides it by the standard deviation, effectively
    standardizing the input to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. If affine transformation is enabled,
    it further applies scaling and shifting to the standardized input.

    Reverses the normalization process for the given slice of the input tensor.

    This method applies the inverse of the normalization operation. If affine transformation was applied during
    normalization, it reverses this process first. Then, it multiplies the tensor by the standard deviation and adds
    the mean to denormalize the data.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): Normalized tensor that needs to be denormalized.
        target_slice (slice, optional): Specific slice of the tensor to denormalize. Useful when different parts
                                         of the tensor require different reverse operations.
